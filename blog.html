        <h2>What is HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create web
          structure. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
          Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
          describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
          included cues for the appearance of the document.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
          compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web
          pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
          defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
          enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the
          text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
          Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early
          text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command
          developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing
          System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from
          the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
          However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements
          (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print
          effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has
          been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
